            Bangalore the silicon valley of India has seen tremendous growth in the last 20 years. The city has not only seen an incoming of migrants
            from all across the nation but as a result the city itself has been expanding has witnessed considerable 
            urban sprawl. As a result of this uncontrolled population rise and rapid urbanisation, there has been a 
            major ecological impact on the city. The city of lakes is now to be known as the city of dying lakes as the city 
            which once boasted of a 1000 lakes is now home to less than 100. Bengaluru has lost as much as 450 acres of wetland from 42 prominent 
            lake areas in the last 20 years and one thouand acres have been eutrophicated, a study has revealed. According to the recent study by a city based researcher, out of the 42 lakes, 41 have 
            been encroached with an average reduction of 10.33% in the physical area. Bellandur and Varthur lakes have witnessed the highest 
            decline in area sue to the encroachment. The lakes that still exist are also being 
            affected by silting, frothing, eutrophication and encroachent. While the water resources of the city are drying up 
            the need of drinkable water in the city is growing exponentially with the growing population and housing needs. <br>
            Eutrophication is overwhelming plant or algae growth due to accumulation of excess nutrients in a waterbody.
